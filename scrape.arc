; Hacker News scraper.
;
; Fetches the live HN front page (and page 2) so flagged / dead /
; collapsed comments (which the official Firebase API doesn't expose)
; can be recovered by parsing the HTML directly.  Items + comments
; come from the HTML; user profiles come from the Firebase API for
; speed.
;
; Usage:
;   ./sharc scrape.arc                         ; one-shot crawl
;   arc> (load "scrape.arc") (scrape!)         ; same, interactive
;   arc> (load "scrape.arc") (import-scrape!)  ; load JSON into News
;
; Output:
;   arc/scrape/cookies.txt           curl cookie jar (HN session)
;   arc/scrape/item/{id}.json        merged story + comment tree
;   arc/scrape/user/{id}.json        user profile
;   arc/scrape/last-fetch.lisp       per-id last-fetched timestamps
;
; Respects the Crawl-delay from https://news.ycombinator.com/robots.txt
; between HTML page fetches (no delay for Firebase user lookups, which
; hit a separate host that doesn't publish one).
